## About Churn
The **state** and **status** of this library and it's slowversioning increments _seem_ to be having an impact on it's long term viability and support.

This adapted variation from [Intercooler JS](https://intercoolerjs.org/docs#conclusion) clarifies  why Pandas TA does not have frequent versioning.

"This is not because it is dead, but rather because it is (mostly) right: the basic idea is right, and the implementation at least right enough.

Thus there will not be constant activity and churn on the project, but rather a stewardship relationship, where the main goal now is to not screw it up. Documentation and testing will be improved, features/indicators will be added/removed as needed, but there will be no massive rewrite or constant updating. This is in contrast with the software industry in general, which often has comical levels of churn."

# Support :broken_heart:
**A big thank you to all current and past sponsors, whose generous support has been and continues to be essential to the success of the project!** :pray:

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/twopirllc) [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/K3K4ZRH9D)

Despite what the usage metrics indicate, current and past levels of support are **unsustainable** for maintaining and improving the library. Unless  significant additional support is provided by _July 1st, 2026_, this widely used library will be **archived**. Support through [contributions](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta/labels/help%20wanted), [donations](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/twopirllc) & [sponsorships](https://github.com/twopirllc) is **necessary** to ensure the project's continued success and development.
